# Dual-Axis Solar Tracker  

**Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System** is an **Arduino-based automated solar tracker** that optimizes **solar panel alignment** for maximum sunlight absorption. By dynamically adjusting both **horizontal and vertical angles** using **photoresistors and servo motors**, this system increases **energy efficiency by up to 40%** compared to fixed solar panels.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Real-time sun tracking** using LDR sensors  
✅ **Dual-axis movement** for optimal alignment  
✅ **Arduino-controlled** automation  
✅ **Increased energy efficiency** and solar power output  
✅ **Cost-effective & easy to implement**  

## 🛠 Components Used  
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino  
- **Sensors**: Photoresistors (LDRs)  
- **Motors**: Servo motors for movement  
- **Power Source**: Solar panel  
- **Framework**: Custom control algorithm for tracking  

## 📌 Working Principle  
1. **Sunlight Detection**: Four **photoresistors** placed at different angles detect sunlight intensity.  
2. **Data Processing**: The **Arduino** processes input from sensors to determine the sun’s position.  
3. **Servo Motor Adjustment**: The system **rotates the solar panel** to align it perpendicular to sunlight.  
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Adjusts orientation throughout the day for **maximum energy absorption**.  

## 🛠 Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker.git
   cd Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker
   ```  
2. Upload the **Arduino code** (`solar_tracker.ino`) to your Arduino board.  
3. Assemble the **photoresistor sensors and servo motors** as per the circuit diagram.  
4. Power up the system and **test solar panel movements**.
